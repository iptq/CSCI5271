For this progress report, I've continued investigating the app, especially in
ways it could be circumvented. Through this investigation, I've learned a lot
about how Google Chrome extensions actually inject scripts into the page, as
well as security implications of doing so. In particular, I learned that content
scripts belonging to extensions are executed in a separate space from the page,
and so the only way they could possibly interact with the page is through
appending text-only attributes to the page when it loads.

I also patched the bug where window.open could be exploited to use the APIs of
another open window, by replacing that call with a Proxy object that calls the
blocking function on the returned window object. Elliott made the addition of
blocking all APIs recursively from there, something I overlooked. Here's a link
to my fork of the extension, including the Proxy patch developed by me and
Elliott:

Finally, our group spent some time working on the paper, which Sam submitted a
first draft of tonight.
